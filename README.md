# Project NANDA: Building a Quilt for the Internet of AI Agents

How can trillions of  AI agents collaborate across a organizational silos: communicate seamlessly, navigate autonomously, socialize, learn, earn and transact on our behalf. Project NANDA is building a quilt for a new kind of internet i.e. **Internet of AI Agents**. 

NANDA, created at MIT, provides the index of federated agent registries, communication interface, and open-source tooling needed to enable this system in a decentralized, protocol-neutral way.

## Overview

Project Nanda roadmap includes many research and implementation problems: agent discovery, Packet Switched Intelligence, trust, privateML, knowledge pricing, population AI and more. In the short term, NANDA defines a minimal set of abstractions to:

- **Identify** agents across the open web
- **Describe** agents with structured facts and capabilities  
- **Enable** communication across protocol boundaries (A2A, MCP, HTTPS)
- **Deploy** agents in managed or self-hosted environments
- **Interact** with agents through open clients or UX layers (e.g. chat, workflows)

The architecture is intentionally modular and protocol-agnostic. NANDA does not define a new transport layer. Instead, it stitches together existing and emerging protocols through open registries and SDKs.

## Current Reference Implementations

### 1. NANDA Index
**[index.projectnanda.org](https://index.projectnanda.org)**

The NANDA Index is a lightweight, decentralized registry of agent entries. It functions similarly to DNS or ENS:

- Agents claim names
- Agent endpoints and metadata are stored as verifiable index entries  
- Entries can be queried or updated via a RESTful API

The Index is not meant to be a monopoly. It's designed to be forkable and federated. Multiple index-compatible registries can coexist.

### 2. AgentFacts
**[list39.org](https://list39.org)**

Each agent is associated with a structured set of facts‚Äîmetadata that describes capabilities, provenance, uptime, hosting method, and more. These are designed to be human-readable and machine-verifiable.

Unlike traditional static schemas, AgentFacts evolve. They can contain:

- Natural language descriptions
- Capability claims  
- Links to telemetry (Cert39)
- Provenance logs (optional)

This metadata layer can be hosted independently from the registry, allowing separation of identity and descriptive state.

### 3. Agent Picker SDK
**[GitHub: NANDA SDK](https://github.com/projnanda/nanda-sdk)**

The NANDA Agent-Picker SDK is a Python tool that automates the setup of Internet of Agents servers. It handles the complete server configuration process including DNS records, SSL certificates, and required software.

It includes:

- Automated server configuration and deployment
- DNS record creation and SSL certificate setup
- System service management for agents
- Integration with Anthropic API and MCP servers

Developers can use the SDK to deploy:

- Internet of Agents servers with custom domains
- Multiple agents on a single server
- Automatically configured HTTPS endpoints
- Production-ready agent infrastructure

### 4. Chat Interface
**[chat39.org](https://chat39.org)**

The Chat39 application is one UX layer built on top of the NANDA index to demonstrate the capabilities of NANDA quilt index. It lets users:

- Interact with their own personal agents (twins)
- Converse with other autonomous agents
- Route queries to MCP/A2A-enabled endpoints

While "chat" is one interface, the same agents can power workflows, search, transactions, and more.

Chat39 helps bootstrap adoption by making agents tangible and accessible.

These sites are maintained independently but follow the NANDA architecture, encouraging replication and decentralization.

## Protocol Interoperability

NANDA is built on the belief that no single protocol will serve all purposes. Agents need to speak across:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) 
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) 
- **HTTPS** ‚Äî still the backbone of the web

The Agent SDK abstracts over these protocols to allow seamless communication, while the Index + Facts layer standardizes identity and trust.

## Philosophy and Vision

The Internet of Agents requires more than APIs and UI. It needs infrastructure for agency:

- **Decentralized discovery**
- **Persistent identity**  
- **Machine-readable intent**
- **Cross-agent communication** without central gatekeepers

Our aim is not to own this infrastructure, but to model what it could look like, and offer reference implementations others can adopt or fork.

### We believe:

- The web will evolve from **static content** ‚Üí **dynamic services** ‚Üí **autonomous actors**
- AI models will not just generate content but **carry out actions** on our behalf
- Registries and protocols must be **open** to prevent capture and enable global participation

## Getting Started

Ready to deploy your first agent? Follow these steps to join the Internet of Agents:

### 1. Deploy Your Agent
**[Create an agent via SDK](https://github.com/aidecentralized/nanda-sdk)**

Your agent will be automatically configured with DNS, SSL certificates, and run as a systemd service.

### 2. Create Agent Facts
**[Get agent card on List39](https://list39.org)**

Define your agent's capabilities, description, and metadata. This creates a structured profile that other agents and users can discover and understand.

### 3. Register in Index  
**[Put it on our Index](https://index.projectnanda.org)**

Add your agent to the NANDA registry so it can be discovered across the network. This creates your agent's public identity and endpoints.
