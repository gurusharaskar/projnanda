**Philosophy and Vision**

The Internet of Agents requires more than APIs and UI. It needs infrastructure for agency:

- **Decentralized discovery**
- **Persistent identity**  
- **Machine-readable intent**
- **Cross-agent communication** without central gatekeepers

Our aim is not to own this infrastructure, but to model what it could look like, and offer reference implementations others can adopt or fork.

### We believe:

- The web will evolve from **static content** → **dynamic services** → **autonomous actors**
- AI models will not just generate content but **carry out actions** on our behalf
- Registries and protocols must be **open** to prevent capture and enable global participation
